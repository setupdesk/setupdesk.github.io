The american college of cardiology/american heart association task force on practice guidelines was formed to make recommendations regarding the appropriate use of testing in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease. A treadmill exercise stress test is used to determine the effects of exercise on the heart. Positive findings on a stress test can lead to invasive cardiac angiogram; Exercise stress test may be warranted for previously sedentary people with additional risk factors for cvd who wish to undertake exercise more.
