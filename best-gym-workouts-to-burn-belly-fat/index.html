According to fitness experts, using a stationary bike for an hour can help you burn more than 500 calories. Research shows that interval training can improve insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, both of which can promote belly fat loss. If we estimate that your metabolism would use 50 calories per day to sustain that muscle, this means you will burn 250 more calories every day (50 calories/day x 5 pounds). Running, jogging, or walking briskly at an incline burns more calories than you can ever imagine.
