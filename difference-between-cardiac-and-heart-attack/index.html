<p>5 differences between a heart attack and a cardiac arrest: Sudden cardiac arrest is an unexpected, sudden death caused by sudden cardiac arrest (loss of heart function). A heart attack is a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the heart muscle is blocked. Cardiac arrest is an electrical problem where a malfunction in the heart’s electrical system causes it to stop beating. Heart Attack, Cardiac Arrest and Heart Failure..They are all different.</p>

<h3 id="this-leads-to-unconsciousness-decrease-of-pulse-and-even-death">This Leads To Unconsciousness, Decrease Of Pulse And Even Death.</h3><p>However, during a cardiac arrest, the heart malfunctions and stops functioning abruptly or suddenly. Most of the time, a blood clot forms in one of the arteries that supply the heart muscle, blocking the flow of blood that it needs to nourish it. The heart muscle is robbed of its vital blood. The heart suddenly stops functioning, and the heart quits pumping blood to our vital organs and beating in a cardiac arrest, while one is generated by a blockage and the other is caused by an electrical breakdown.</p>
<h3 id="electrical-malfunction-in-the-heart-that-causes">Electrical Malfunction In The Heart That Causes.</h3><p>Heart attacks increase the risk of cardiac arrest. During a cardiac arrest, the conduction system of the heart fails, and the heart develops asystole (no heartbeat is generated). As the heart muscle starves, it begins to die.
