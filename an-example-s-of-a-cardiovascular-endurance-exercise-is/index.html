Lateral shuffles are some of the best exercises to improve cardiovascular endurance for both beginners and pros. Cardiovascular exercise, also known as aerobic exercise, is exercise that burns fat and increases the heart rate, and which requires a certain amount of endurance over a long period of time. More technically, cardiovascular exercise is anything which forces the body to use its ‘aerobic’ system to get energy. Cardiovascular endurance is the ability to exercise without becoming overly tired.
