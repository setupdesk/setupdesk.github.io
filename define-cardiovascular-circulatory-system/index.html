Circulatory System Definition, Diagram and Functioning From scienceabc.com
The human circulatory system consists of a network of arteries, veins, and capillaries, with the heart pumping blood through it. The bottom tip of the heart, known as its apex, is turned to the left, so that about 2/3 of the heart is located on the body’s left side with the other 1/3 on right. The cardiovascular system in all vertebrates, consists of the heart and blood vessels. The circulatory system is the structure made up of the heart, blood vessels and blood and whose main function is the transport or circulation of all nutrients, waste, oxygen, antibodies, electrolytes, among other substances through the blood, to all cells and tissues of the body.
