Cardiorespiratory Fitness Levels may determine the Risk of CHD From medindia.net
Have suggested that measures of crf may be more strongly associated with disease outcomes than physical inactivity. This reveals your body&#39;s capacity for transporting and using oxygen during exercise. A good way for most people to achieve a moderate level of cardiorespiratory fitness is to follow the latest federal guidelines for physical activity: The treadmill test began at a speed of 88 m·min −1 and 0% elevation.
