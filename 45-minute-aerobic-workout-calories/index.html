Anyone with no physical limitations can probably burn around 300 calories in a 45 minute light workout that’s about as strenuous as a slightly brisk walk. (180/2.20462) * 6.6 * 0.0175 * 30 minutes = 283 30. If you prefer a cardio workout, you can make them out of calisthenics, treadmill runs and aerobics routines. Is 45 minutes of exercise a day enough?
