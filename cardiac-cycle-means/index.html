<p>The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. Heart tissue is myogenic which means it would initiate its own contraction allowing the heart to contract without needing to be connected to the body. The cardiac cycle describes the electrical and mechanical actions of the heart, contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles during every heartbeat.

<p>The closure of the atrioventricular valves causes the first heart sound, also known. At rest, the heart pumps around 5l of blood around the body every minute, but this can increase massively during exercise. Left atrial pressure rises during ventricular systole (v wave) as blood returns to the left atrium by means of the pulmonary veins. It is a period of relaxation of the heart chamber when refilling of the heart occurs. Cardiac Cycle Cardiac Pinterest.</p>

<p>The aortic valve closes when left ventricular pressure falls below aortic pressure. For the heart to function effectively, there must be a fine control and balance of events that take place during the cardiac cycle described above. As the heart beats, it circulates blood through pulmonary and systemic circuits of the body. In the diastole phase, heart ventricles relax and the heart fills with blood. The Cardiac Cycle.</p>
<h3 id="duration-of-cardiac-cycle-3">Duration Of Cardiac Cycle 3.</h3><p>The cardiac cycle refers to a complete heartbeat from its generation to the beginning of the next beat, and so includes the diastole (relaxation),. Each cardiac cycle begins with the generation of an electrical stimulus in the sinus node and the consequent contraction of the atria and ends with the relaxation of the ventricles.
