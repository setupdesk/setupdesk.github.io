The practice of resistance exercises can reverse this picture, helping to maintain the muscular mass and improving muscular strength and resistance. Arterial hypertension (htn) is a highly prevalent chronic medical condition, characterized by high and sustained levels of blood pressure (bp) ().its progression can cause structural and functional changes in target organs and in the metabolic system, leading to clinical complications and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (). Again, this can increase blood pressure, as it requires the heart to pump blood against gravity up to the working muscles. Weightlifting can cause a temporary (during weightlifting session) increase in blood pressure.
