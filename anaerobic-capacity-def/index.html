It is believed that aerobic capacity is directly proportional to cardiorespiratory fitness based on heart rate factors often. Generally, the idea is the following. Aerobic capacity, also called maximal oxygen uptake, is characterized by the amount of oxygen the body produces and circulates to all major organs to regulate systemic homeostasis.

<p>It is believed that aerobic capacity is directly proportional to cardiorespiratory fitness based on heart rate factors often. Anaerobic creatures or processes do not need oxygen in order to function or survive. Anaerobic exercise occurs when your body needs to use other energy sources besides oxygen — such as lactic acid — to continue performing. Fast twitch muscles (as compared to slow twitch muscles) operate using anaerobic metabolic systems, such that any use of fast twitch muscle fibers leads to an increased anaerobic energy expenditure.
