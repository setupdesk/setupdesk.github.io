Respiration is the process of breaking down complex organic compounds and producing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. The equation for the anaerobic respiration process,glucose→ alcohol&#43; carbon dioxide&#43; energy. Respiration is a continuous process in every living organism and without respiration no organism can survive on the earth.

<p>Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. When cellular respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration and when it occurs in the absence of oxygen it is called anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration involves a gas exchange in which oxygen is taken and carbon dioxide is expelled. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen.</p>

Aerobic respiration is a set of metabolic reactions that take place in the presence of oxygen, occurring in a cell to convert chemical energy into atps. On the other hand, anaerobic bacteria, yeast cells, prokaryotes, and muscle cells perform anaerobic respiration.

<p>It is the release of a relatively large amount of energy in cells by the breakdown of food substances in the presence of oxygen: Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives. It is called anaerobic respiration because it takes place without air which contains oxygen (anaerobic means 'without air).
