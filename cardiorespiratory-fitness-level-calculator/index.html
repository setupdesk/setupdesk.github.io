It&#39;s not the same as having an actual test, but you&#39;ll get a good idea of where you are for your age. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of different physical fitness levels [assessed by the maximal oxygen uptake (vo2max) test] with cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factors in patients with ra. The results showed that in samples under 25 years of age, the level of cardiorespiratory fitness was moderate to low; Vo2 max calculator is intended for every sportsman who want to find their maximal aerobic capacity value.
