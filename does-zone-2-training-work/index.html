<p>Zone 2, as depicted in that graph, is below the aerobic threshold (the threshold that divides the green from the yellow). Zone 2 training occurs when we perform a steady activity while maintaining a particular heart rate for longer periods of time, say 45 or 50 minutes, twice or three times a week. Zone 2 is steady training just coming above the easy zone, it’s not moderate or anything above. Zone 2 sits between the active recovery zone and the tempo zone, and is the pace you naturally fall into when you are endurance training.</p>
