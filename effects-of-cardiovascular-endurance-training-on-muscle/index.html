The 5 Components of Fitness Which Improves Cardiovascular Endurance From fitnesss.net
Not only will you have more energy and stamina for work, sports, and everyday activities, but your psychological wellbeing and heart health will. With endurance training, there will be an increase in glycogen (and fat) storage in muscles. Along with the blood vessels, it forms a network for carrying blood containing oxygen and nutrients to the body, and removing waste (carbon dioxide). Endurance exercise training produces numerous metabolic and cardiovascular effects.
