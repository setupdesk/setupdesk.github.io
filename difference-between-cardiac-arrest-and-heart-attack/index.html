The difference between heart attack and cardiac arrest is that heart attacks are a circulation problem and cardiac arrest is an electrical problem.
Heart Attack vs. Cardiac Arrest Do You Know the Difference? Penn From pennmedicine.org
Normally, the heart is controlled by regular electrical impulses that make it beat. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating, whereas a heart attack occurs when the heart continues to beat despite disruption in the blood flow to the heart. Cardiac arrests cause the stopping of the heart, leading to heart failure primarily due to ventricular fibrillation.
