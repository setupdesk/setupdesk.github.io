This series of biochemical reactions is also called a “metabolic pathway.”. The first step, like aerobic respiration, is glycolysis,. Aerobic respiration takes place in presence of oxygen where as anaerobic respiration can occur even in absence of oxygen. Respiration using oxygen to break down food molecules is called aerobic respiration.
