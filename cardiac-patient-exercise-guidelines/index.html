PPT ACSM’s Guidelines For Exercise Testing And Prescription Chapter From slideserve.com
Exercise testing is widely available and relatively low in cost. Guideline documents for cardiac rehabilitation typically contain recommendations for exercise training common to all cardiac patients, with there being little variation in exercise prescription details between clinical conditions. Exercise intensity is grouped into the following categories: Cardiac rehabilitation patients with comorbid cnslbp are encouraged to follow rt guidelines for apparently healthy sedentary adults without cnslbp (3,5) and should complete rt workouts consisting of 8 to 10 exercises—all of which emphasize major muscle groups—on 2 to 3 nonconsecutive days of the week.
