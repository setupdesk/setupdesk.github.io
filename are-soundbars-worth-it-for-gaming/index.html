Taotronics TTSK027 Gaming Soundbar With RGB Led Lights Rgb led From in.pinterest.com
I&#39;ve been looking at the samsung q80r soundbar but some reviews i&#39;ve read say that it&#39;s not worth the money. I have a 7.2 setup, and it is games that really makes it shine. Since a soundbar is a dedicated speaker, it’s a lot better at handling both ends of the volume spectrum. Soundbars are great addition for your tv, sometimes we dont have the space for a full surround sound system or the money and thats where soundbars come in.
