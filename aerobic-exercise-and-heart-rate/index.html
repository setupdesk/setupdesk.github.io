The main objective of doing cardiovascular exercise is to have the ideal heart rate and have a good heart rate for our heart. Heart rate variability, a noninvasive marker of parasympathetic activity, diminishes with aging and is augmented after exercise training. The bottom line is ‘proper’ aerobic exercise makes your heart more efficient at transporting oxygen throughout your body. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of aerobic physical training (apt) on heart rate variability (hrv) and cardiorespiratory responses at peak condition and ventilatory anaerobic threshold.
