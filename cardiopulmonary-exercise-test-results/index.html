<p>Cardiopulmonary exercise test (cpet) is used to evaluate patients with chronic heart failure (hf) usually by means of a personalized ramp exercise protocol. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is the most comprehensive technique which allows a holistic approach to cardiopulmonary diseases. The co 2 analyzer should read a room air fraction of 0.03±0.02% and should not change when the 100% n 2 or 16% o 2 fractions are sampled from the calibration tanks. Information about the heart and lungs is collected to understand if the body’s response to exercise is normal or abnormal. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test Results in the Study Patients With.</p>
