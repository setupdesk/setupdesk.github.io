<p>Cardiopulmonary exercise test (cpet) is used to evaluate patients with chronic heart failure (hf) usually by means of a personalized ramp exercise protocol. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is the most comprehensive technique which allows a holistic approach to cardiopulmonary diseases. The co 2 analyzer should read a room air fraction of 0.03Â±0.02% and should not change when the 100% n 2 or 16% o 2 fractions are sampled from the calibration tanks.
