Anaerobic exercises also stimulate the production of testosterone in the body, which is needed for tissue growth. We did the math to show calorie.

<p>Learning and remembering choreography keeps your brain active while constant movement addresses your heart, circulation, balance, muscles and joints. Not sure about calories but 2 of the classes are 1.5 hrs and the other two are 1.25 hours so total ballet each week is 5.5 hours. If you’re out of breath, it’s more likely due to technique, unless you’re really physically unfit. Dancing is an exercise that engages the entire body as well as the mind.
